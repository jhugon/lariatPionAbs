LArIAT Pion Absorption Analysis
===============================

This repository holds code for the LArIAT pion absorption analysis. The code
here processes the anaTree files produced by LArIATSoft.

The .C parts of the code are meant to create tree friends for the main anaTrees
with higher-level variables. the .py parts of the code use tree.Draw() to
create histograms and paint them to image files
